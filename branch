A branch is effectively a pointer to the last commit you made (ignoring the complication of a detached HEAD state). The default branch is ‘master.’ When you create a new branch, you’re creating a new pointer; initially this will point to your last commit (likely the same as ‘master’). You select which branch you want to work on using the checkout command - a special pointer called ‘HEAD’ is what controls this. If I make a series of commits on the new branch, i can then checkout back to the ‘master’ branch. The master branch will point to the last commit before I began working on the new brach - effectively it takes me back in time. I could then switch back to the new branch if wanted. Branches are useful because it allows developers to work on new features (in new branches) and then merge them into the master branch or just discard them and revert back to the master branch.
